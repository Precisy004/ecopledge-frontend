# 🌿 EcoPledge Tracker

*A MERN Stack project aligned with UN SDG 13 – Climate Action*

### 💡 Overview

**EcoPledge** is a full-stack web application that encourages individuals to take positive environmental actions.
Users can log their eco-friendly activities — such as recycling, using bicycles, or planting trees — and track their progress through a personal dashboard, leaderboard, and weekly activity chart.

This project was built with the **MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)** and styled using **TailwindCSS** and **Recharts**.

### 🌍 Why This Project Matters

Climate change remains one of the most urgent global challenges. EcoPledge contributes to **UN Sustainable Development Goal 13 (Climate Action)** by:

* Promoting environmentally conscious habits
* Quantifying and visualizing individual contributions
* Encouraging friendly competition through the leaderboard system
* Building a community of people committed to sustainable living
